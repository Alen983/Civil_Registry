registration details as well as to help to register or apply for those documents. The main purpose of the

at government offices. The project entitled “CIVIL REGISTRY” is a web-based system or agency to help 
Indian citizens to apply for various records like passport, driving license, voter’s ID card, ration card etc.

for these certificates and view the details regarding the documents. In order to apply for any certificate or 
government records a citizen needs to present at the government offices and it will increase unwanted 
rushes at the government offices and time wasting</p>
